# Changelog

All notable changes to deser are documented here.

## 0.4.0

- Restructure serialization and deserialization to pass `Atom` values
  within `Event` and `Chunk`.  This changes the interface from invoking
  type specific methods on the sink to passing an entire `Atom` instead.
- Events are now passed by value rather than reference.
- Added basic support for `Option<T>`.
