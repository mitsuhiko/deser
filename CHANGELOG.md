# Changelog

All notable changes to deser are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Made `derive` a default feature.
- Removed number serialization support in JSON serializer.

## 0.8.0

- Removed `for_each_event`.
- Added `speedups` feature for `serde-json` to use `ryu` and `itoa`.
- Added deserialization support for BTreeSet and HashSet.
- `Option<T>` is now automatically defaulted in structs, even if
  `#[deser(default)]` is not provided.  If this distinction between
  missing and null is needed `Option<Option<T>>` can be used.
- Removed non String serialization support for deser-json for now.

## 0.7.0

- Added support for `Box<T>`.
- Added newtype struct support for derive feature.
- `Driver` is now called `DeserializeDriver`.
- Added `SerializeDriver`.
- Added `deser-json`.

## 0.6.0

- Made `Atom` non exhaustive and added `unexpected_atom` to `Deserialize`.
- Removed `MapSink` and `SeqSink`.  The functionality of these is now
  directly on the `Sink`.
- The serializer state and deserializer state is now passed to `next_key`/
  `next_value` and `next` on the sinks and emitters.
- Added support for `#[deser(flatten)]`.

## 0.5.0

- Added support for `#[deser(default)]` in deriving.
- Added support for `#[deser(skip_serializing_optionals)]`.
- Removed `ignore` and replaced it with `SinkHandle::null`.
- Added tuple support.
- Added array support.
- Added support for `#[deser(alias)]`.
- Added support for characters to the data model.
- Added support for serializing references.

## 0.4.0

- Restructure serialization and deserialization to pass `Atom` values
  within `Event` and `Chunk`.  This changes the interface from invoking
  type specific methods on the sink to passing an entire `Atom` instead.
- Events are now passed by value rather than reference.
- Added basic support for `Option<T>`.
- Added basic support for deriving simple enums.
