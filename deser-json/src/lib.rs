//! Parse and serialize JSON compatible with deser.
//!
//! This library is very bare bones at this point and not at all optimized.  It is
//! based on microserde which in turn is based on miniserde to achieve the most
//! minimal implementation of a serializer and serializer.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let vec: Vec<u64> = deser_json::from_str("[1, 2, 3, 4]").unwrap();
//! let json = deser_json::to_string(&vec).unwrap();
//! ```
